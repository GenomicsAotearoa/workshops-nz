Genomics Aotearoa, NeSI and Carpentries are working closely together to deliver free workshops to upskill researchers in New Zealand. The site will capture all the training that will be happening around the country as well as the links to the workshops. The information on this site is not restricted to only training from the mentioned organisations, therefore we encourage all instructors/trainers in New Zealand to post their workshop details as well and collaborate with us.
