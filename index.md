Many Universities, Crown research institutions, and other groups coordinate and deliver valuable upskilling opportunities for NZ based researchers. This page, originally created by Genomics Aotearoa and New Zealand eScience Infrastructure, is for listing NZ-friendly digital skills workshops. We encourage anyone who is instructing at or coordinating a training event to post their workshop details on this page, even if it is a 'closed' or private event.  

**Page purpose:** to raise awareness of NZ training events and encourage inter-institutional collaboration.

**How to add a workshop to this page:** Instructions coming soon

## Upcoming Workshops
 
### Otago Bioinformatics Spring School – In person, Dunedin, 22-26 November 2021.
Genomics Aotearoa and NeSI are proud supporters of the Bioinformatics Spring School 2021 being organised by Otago Carpentries. This is an intensive one week, in-person course tackling the basics of bash and R, high performance computers and genomics analysis (DNA Variant calling, Genotyping-by-Sequencing, RNA-seq and eDNA).
For more information and a link to register your expression of interest please refer to https://otagocarpentries.github.io/bioinformatics-spring-school-2021/
Expressions of interest close 5pm 1st September (NZ)
 
### Eukaryotic Genome Assembly and Annotation Workshop – In person, Auckland, 1-3 December 2021  
This three-day workshop, supported by Genomics Aotearoa and NeSI, will cover contemporary approaches to assembling, annotating, and evaluating eukaryotic genomes from long read (Oxford Nanopore) sequencing datasets. Sessions will include hands-on bioinformatics exercises, demonstrations, and discussions.  In the course of the workshop, participants will (1) test several assembly algorithms, polishing tools and parameter sets, (2) annotate the repeats, genes and other functional content, (3) explore approaches for evaluating these assemblies, and (4) delve deeper into the comparative genomics and biological content of the assembly.  
  
Prerequisites:  
Participants are expected to have prior experience of working at the command line. Priority will be given to those who can demonstrate relevance of the material covered to their own projects.  
Expression of interest: https://otago.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d7hTbMVrZrTMz54
Expressions of interest close 5pm Friday, 17th of September (NZ)

## Dates TBA
### Metagenomics Summer School – In person, Postponed to June/July 2022
We are now accepting expressions of interest for the summer school. Please see the attached GA github for more details on the content covered.
This is a 4 day course that covers the whole metagenomics data analysis pipeline through hands on bioinformatics analysis, discussions, group assignments and talks.

### mixOmics workshop for omics data integration, Palmerston North, Postponed to early 2022
There will be a mixOmics workshop at Massey University, Palmerston North. More details, including a tentative content, to be fine-tuned with the audience can be found at this link: http://mixomics.org/2021/05/june-28-30-2021-palmerston-north-nz-beginner/

## Past Workshops

### Imputation Workshop, 11th August 2021 - LIC, Hamilton
Genotype imputation is a key component of modern genetic studies. It is a cost-efficient approach to approximate high-density genotypes or full sequence data from low-density genotypes/low-pass sequencing data of individuals. This workshop is intended for anyone interested in learning how to use either Beagle or Minimac to impute genotypes and how to evaluate the imputation performance. A brief overview of imputation will be followed by demonstrations and exercises, including:
- Quality control and preparation of genetic data for imputation 
- Evaluate the imputation performance using different parameters <br>

#### Environmental DNA Workshop, 24-25 June 2021, Auckland
Advances in genomics over the past decade have greatly expanded the breadth of community ecology, and enabled fine scale study of many ecosystems. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is DNA material isolated from environmental substrates, including water, soil, air, or even within larger organisms (using a broader definition of ‘environment’). The eDNA samples can be amplified with PCR and sequenced with next-generation sequencing technologies to study the biodiversity of the environment, in a method called metabarcoding. In this workshop we will review the most common methods for metabarcoding in order to identify the taxonomic components and determine the relationship across these communities. Through a combination of demonstration and hands-on practicals, you will learn the basic concepts and core tools needed to analyse eDNA metabarcoding data for a wide range of studies. <br>
