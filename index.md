Many Universities, Crown research institutions, and other groups coordinate and deliver valuable upskilling opportunities for NZ based researchers. This page, originally created by Genomics Aotearoa and New Zealand eScience Infrastructure, is for listing NZ-friendly digital skills workshops. We encourage anyone who is instructing at or coordinating a training event to post their workshop details on this page, even if it is a 'closed' or private event.  

**Page purpose:** to raise awareness of NZ training events and encourage inter-institutional collaboration.

## Upcoming Workshops
## July 2021
### Genomics Data Carpentry, 27-28 July, Online
Co-hosted by Genomics Aotearoa and NeSI, this online introductory workshop will help you get started with genomic data analysis. Specifically, attendees can expect to learn: 
Project organization and management - Learn how to structure your metadata, organize and document your genomics data and bioinformatics workflow, and access data on the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) database.
Introduction to the command line - Learn to navigate your file system, create, copy, move, and remove files and directories, and automate repetitive tasks using scripts and wildcards.
Data wrangling and processing - Use command-line tools to perform quality control, align reads to a reference genome, and identify and visualize between-sample variation.
Introduction to cloud computing and High Performance Computers (HPCs) for genomics - Learn how to work with NeSI HPCs and how to transfer data between your local computer and the HPC platform.
 
Prerequisites:
This online workshop is for beginners to bioinformatics but basic genomics knowledge is expected. Learners should have some familiarity with biological concepts and must bring their own laptops. This is a hands-on workshop and participants are encouraged to participate actively.
 
Registration: 
To attend, you must register in advance. Instructions for connecting to the online session will be emailed to all registrants.

## August 2021

### Imputation Workshop, 11th August 2021 - LIC, Hamilton
Genotype imputation is a key component of modern genetic studies. It is a cost-efficient approach to approximate high-density genotypes or full sequence data from low-density genotypes/low-pass sequencing data of individuals. This workshop is intended for anyone interested in learning how to use either Beagle or Minimac to impute genotypes and how to evaluate the imputation performance. A brief overview of imputation will be followed by demonstrations and exercises, including:
- Quality control and preparation of genetic data for imputation 
- Evaluate the imputation performance using different parameters <br>

## Past Workshops

#### Environmental DNA Workshop, 24-25 June 2021, Auckland
Advances in genomics over the past decade have greatly expanded the breadth of community ecology, and enabled fine scale study of many ecosystems. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is DNA material isolated from environmental substrates, including water, soil, air, or even within larger organisms (using a broader definition of ‘environment’). The eDNA samples can be amplified with PCR and sequenced with next-generation sequencing technologies to study the biodiversity of the environment, in a method called metabarcoding. In this workshop we will review the most common methods for metabarcoding in order to identify the taxonomic components and determine the relationship across these communities. Through a combination of demonstration and hands-on practicals, you will learn the basic concepts and core tools needed to analyse eDNA metabarcoding data for a wide range of studies. <br>
