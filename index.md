Many Universities, Crown research institutions, and other groups coordinate and deliver valuable upskilling opportunities for NZ based researchers. This page, originally created by Genomics Aotearoa and New Zealand eScience Infrastructure, is for listing NZ-friendly digital skills workshops. We encourage anyone who is instructing at or coordinating a training event to post their workshop details on this page, even if it is a 'closed' or private event.  

**Page purpose:** to raise awareness of NZ training events and encourage inter-institutional collaboration.

**How to add a workshop to this page:** Instructions coming soon
